# Machine-Organization
Fundamental structures of computer systems and the C programming language with a focus on the low-level interrelationships and impacts on performance. C programs in this repo consist of a Heap Simulator: heap and dynamic memory management, Cache Simulator: memory hierarchy and caching, Signal Handler: communication and interrupts/signals.

Not simulated in a C program but covered at length: virtual address space and virtual memory, assembly language and the stack, compiling and assemblers/linkers.
